DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard

    "The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."

    The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:

    •	Core DOM - standard model for all document types
    •	XML DOM - standard model for XML documents
    •	HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents

    The document object represent a web page that is loaded in the browser. 

    By accessing the document object, we can access the element in the HTML page. With the help of document objects, we can add dynamic content to our web page. In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.
